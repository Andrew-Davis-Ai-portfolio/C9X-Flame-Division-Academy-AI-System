## Overview

C9X is a proprietary AI interface and governance-oriented system under staged development by **Flame Division Academy**.

This repository exists to establish **architectural provenance, authorship, and intent** — not to distribute software, demos, or deployable code.

C9X is designed as part of a broader ecosystem focused on:

- AI governance & auditability  
- Operator-grade workflows  
- Human-in-the-loop accountability  
- Defensive system design **before** automation  

---

## Design Philosophy

C9X follows a **governance-first model**:

- Intelligence is not deployed before restraint  
- Automation is not trusted without audit  
- Capability is not released without responsibility  

The system is intended to **observe, structure, and support decision-making** — not replace human judgment.
