# C9X — Flame Division Academy AI System

**Status:** Parked · Under Controlled Development  
**Visibility:** Public (Provenance Only)  
**Release Model:** Intentional · Governance-First

---

## Overview

C9X is a proprietary AI interface and governance-oriented system under staged development by **Flame Division Academy**.

This repository exists to establish **architectural provenance, authorship, and intent**.  
It is **not** a runnable system, demo environment, or open-source release.

C9X is being developed as part of a broader ecosystem focused on:

- AI governance & auditability
- Operator-grade workflows
- Human-in-the-loop accountability
- Defensive system design before automation

---

## Design Philosophy

C9X follows a **governance-first** model:

> Intelligence is not deployed before restraint.  
> Automation is not trusted without audit.  
> Capability is not released without responsibility.

The system is designed to **observe, structure, and support decision-making**, not replace human judgment.
